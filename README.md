# README
This README should mark the start of a new journey, a journey of discovery and improuvement, after taking the decision to learn about how computers function, I later discovered that learning a coding language is essential for this, and the choice have been on python, mainly because my innocent mind followed some youtube recommandations.
I also developed a desire for business(finnaly), I been studying economics for quite some time, but I dont think the education system managed to deliver into our brains whats the actual utility of the information they provide, all theory, not even modern theory, Its some 18th century random homeless hungry guy telling what people want to hear so they pay for his food and shelter, and so I decided for the first time to look for the truth instead of biases, this is gonna take alot of time of effort, but Im okay with paying that as a price If Its gonna lead me to the truth.
Plenty of nerd boring habits are awaiting for me, but surprisingly, after diving deep into theses boring habits, they no longer become boring, your vision for them as useless information get replaced with vision of value, you actual know where their utility resides and how to use them, and so my fear of some topics like math has vanished and I actually get a desire to learn.

I will be documenting mostly everything, so hopefully you find value in viewing my  path :)
